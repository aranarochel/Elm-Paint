# Elm-Paint
Just a small work in progress of a paint application written in Elm.

To compile, download Elm and run elm-compiler with the filename.

*Edit*: This was written before the newest version of Elm currently available. As a result, the current code will not properly compile and requires making some syntactic changes.
